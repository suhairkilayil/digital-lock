# digital-lock
A Verilog-based Digital Lock system that detects the binary pattern "1101" using a Moore finite state machine (FSM). It securely transitions through states and activates an unlock signal only on correct input. Simulated and verified using Xilinx Vivado, the design is ideal for FPGA-based access control applications.
